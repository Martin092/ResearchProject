# SparseSequentialLearning

This repository contains the code for the 
Bachelor Research Project at TUDelft (2025). Paper
and poster can be seen at https://cse3000-research-project.github.io/2025/Q2

This codebase contains algorithms and experiments for sparse
bandits with adaptive feature selection. 

All configurations used for plots in the paper
are in ```/configurations/paper_figures``` and all configurations used for plots in the poster
are in ```/configurations/poster_plots```.

The exact code used for generating the plots can be found 
in ```src/notebooks/paper_plots```.
